TODO:

- Smartly script the resizing and such of windows

- Rules don't seem to be working; handle window grouping and placement in lua?

- New notification daemon

- Custom toggleable bar and padding areas?

- Binding to set window state to follow? (sticky? whatever?)

- What even is monocle mode?
